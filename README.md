## Multi-Device Android Automation Using Python


Python wrapper for the [Android Device Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html) that allows for multiple devices to be connected simultaneously.  

A few of the functions are Phone-Specific, and will only work with select Alcatel One-Touch devices, but the rest should be universal.  I've also created a function that will record and replay screen actions using Python's Pickle.
